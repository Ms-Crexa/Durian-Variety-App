# Firebase Flutter Project Setup

This is a Firebase-based Flutter project that allows integration with Firebase services such as Authentication, Firestore, and Firebase Storage. 

### Prerequisites

- Flutter installed on your machine.
- Firebase project setup on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Google Firebase dependencies installed for Flutter.

### Setting Up Firebase for Your Flutter Project

Follow these steps to set up Firebase in your Flutter project:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new Firebase project if you don't have one already.

2. **Add Firebase to Your Flutter Project**:
   - For **Android**:
     1. In the Firebase console, go to your project settings and select **Add App** for Android.
     2. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in your Flutter project under `android/app/`.
     3. Add the Firebase dependencies in your `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files as specified in the Firebase setup documentation.
   
   - For **iOS**:
     1. In the Firebase console, go to your project settings and select **Add App** for iOS.
     2. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and place it in your Flutter project under `ios/Runner/`.
     3. Update the `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file to configure Firebase as specified in the Firebase setup documentation.

3. **Install Firebase Flutter Plugins**:
   - In your `pubspec.yaml`, add the necessary dependencies for Firebase:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     firebase_core: ^latest_version
     firebase_auth: ^latest_version
     cloud_firestore: ^latest_version
     firebase_storage: ^latest_version
